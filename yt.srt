00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,170
Andy. You came all the way from Utah?

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,362
No. I was in town for a self help seminar. How to Be in the

3
00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:10,774
Right Place at the Right Time. Holy cow, it's working. Oh, gosh.

4
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:14,394
I guess your name will still be my phone is my emergency contact. I use

5
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:17,502
boyfriends to avoid lectures from my parents. I don't want to wake up in a

6
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:20,910
teal in a prison and then be all, like, near grounded.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,450
I'm just glad I could be here. Andy,

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,738
I have to tell you something. I'm really, really sorry,

9
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:30,320
but I'm seeing someone.

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,700
Really? Yeah. Yes.

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,102
Thank goodness. Me too. I just don't know how

12
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:42,558
to tell you. Especially if you're dying. She's a Laker Girl.

13
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:45,680
Oh, wow. It's cheerleader. Nice. No.

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,422
Josephine Scripts. Barnacles of Boats in the Great Salt Lake. We call

15
00:00:49,436 --> 00:00:52,830
them Laker Girls, but they are kind of sex symbols in Utah.

16
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,138
So who is the lucky guy? Well, it's a bit

17
00:00:57,164 --> 00:01:01,162
of a mess right now, but he's he is a professor

18
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:04,450
and an astrophysicist. He's a legit genius.

19
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,058
Hailey, I came as soon as I heard. Actually, that's not

20
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:11,220
true. I stopped for tacos. Not him.
