1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,498
So what type of runner are you? Are you a heel striking runner where you

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:06,642
land on your heel and roll through with each stride, or are you a

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:10,558
forefoot striking runner landing on the balls of your feet? In today's

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,842
video, I'm going to look at the difference between the two types of

5
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:17,406
running technique and the a trade off that occurs between those

6
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:20,970
two different types of footstrike and relate it to your own

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,918
injury history. So let's get straight into this. So the important thing

8
00:00:24,944 --> 00:00:28,810
to appreciate is that when it comes to running form, we can't

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,006
just change our form and do away with forces at certain

10
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:36,810
joints and not to consider those forces anymore. It's just like

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,718
any type of physics, force can't just be lost.

12
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:43,486
Instead, it gets moved around and transferred. That's the underpinning principle

13
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:47,382
to all of this. So whichever way you break it

14
00:00:47,396 --> 00:00:50,614
down, running is a high impact, high load

15
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:54,418
activity. So whether I'm running with a heel strike, whether I'm running with a forefoot

16
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,410
strike, either way, I have to deal with my body weight coming

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,638
down over the top of the landing foot and

18
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:05,166
the impact that comes back with that, the question is where that

19
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:09,490
impact goes. So if I'm running with a heel strike,

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,498
which so often also comes with a slight overstride, so landing further

21
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:17,142
in front of myself, then the initial impact that comes back

22
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:20,994
at my body with that initial contact is

23
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:24,070
experienced ankle, knee, hip,

24
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,766
up through the kinetic chain, and that initial impact.

25
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,182
A lot of the time runners tend to experience

26
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:34,674
in terms of knee pain, if injury is

27
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:38,446
going to start to kick in. So obviously, that's a big generalization.

28
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,082
There are lots of different types of injuries. But in terms of the sorts

29
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:46,026
of injuries that overstriding, heel striking runners do tend to get

30
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:49,978
it's things like telephone, real pain. So runners knee, it's things like tibial,

31
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:53,650
stress fractures, even things like anterior compartment

32
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,286
syndrome around the front of the outside of the Shin. They are classic

33
00:01:57,358 --> 00:02:01,038
kinds of injuries that heel striking runners pick up because

34
00:02:01,124 --> 00:02:05,010
they're the tissues that get overloaded with

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,826
this type of heel striking pattern. Now if

36
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:12,742
we were to move a heel striking runner to more of a forefoot striking pattern,

37
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:16,290
we know that's going to take a little bit of stress and strain off.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,742
For example, the knee femoral joint, we know that it's going to

39
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:24,762
put the ankle in a different position, that's initial contact, which means that

40
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:27,934
the initial eccentric load on muscles like to be asked anterior

41
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:31,218
are going to be less. So we're less likely to be dealing with things like

42
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:34,938
anterior compartment syndrome, but we need to

43
00:02:34,964 --> 00:02:38,686
appreciate that force has to go somewhere. So in reducing

44
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:42,666
the stress on the knee, we end up putting more demand around

45
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:46,198
the ankle. So our Achilles, our calf complex,

46
00:02:46,294 --> 00:02:50,314
end up working a lot harder to dissipate that initial load.

47
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:54,330
So we know that with those two different types of running

48
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,242
style. If one is more stressful for

49
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:02,250
the calf and Achilles complex and the other more stressful around the

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,898
knee in particular, Then we can start to make some

51
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:09,838
sensible decisions based on our individual running injury

52
00:03:09,874 --> 00:03:13,314
histories about how we should potentially start

53
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:17,226
to think about maybe changing our running style or not,

54
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:20,814
maybe leaving it alone. Maybe it's nothing to do with your running

55
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:23,658
style, your injury history, and it's more to do with errors you've made in your

56
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:26,590
training. But when we're thinking about running style,

57
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,634
if I got someone with knee pain and they're overstriding, Then logic would dictate

58
00:03:30,682 --> 00:03:33,798
that perhaps bringing it to more of a mid foot

59
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:37,302
to forefoot strike Would help reduce the knee, the stress and

60
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:40,998
strain around the knee. Whereas if I've got someone who's exactly

61
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:45,150
the same in as much as the fact that they're overstriding and heel striking

62
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,002
and they're dealing with Achilles problems, they're dealing with pain in their

63
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:52,362
Achilles tendon or calf problems, Then I probably don't want

64
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:55,390
to take them and throw them up onto the balls of their feet.

65
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,422
We need to appreciate the way in which those different types

66
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,934
of foot strike Put different stress and strain in different

67
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:06,690
areas of the body and start to think about where our

68
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,750
own injuries have occurred in the past and if it's appropriate

69
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,430
to perhaps make a subtle change to offload the

70
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,174
previously injured area, or if making a change might put more

71
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:21,774
stress and strain on that injured area. And that's exactly why

72
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:25,266
making big changes to your running style is never a good idea.

73
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:29,670
Making small changes is by far the safest way to go Because

74
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,126
it allows your body within the kind of parameters of what it's used to

75
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:37,410
just to start to work on making small improvements over time and

76
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,942
adapting as you go, rather than suddenly taking the stress

77
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:44,502
and strain from one place and moving it to another where perhaps your body is

78
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:47,610
not ready for that stress and strain to go. In fact, if you want to

79
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,358
learn a little bit more about how to improve your running style when it comes

80
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:54,114
to your foot strike, then check out the video that I uploaded to the channel

81
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:58,666
here a few weeks ago which talks about far more detailed

82
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:02,650
approaches to action actually starting to just improve your foot strike,

83
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,318
make it a little bit more efficient and a little bit better for

84
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:09,480
you when it comes to running light underfoot, so go check that out.
