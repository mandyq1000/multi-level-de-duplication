type runner you? heel striking runner land heel roll stride? forefoot striking runner landing balls feet? today's video, I'm going look difference two types running technique trade occurs two different types footstrike relate injury history. let's get straight this. important thing appreciate comes running form, can't change form away forces certain joints consider forces anymore. like type physics. Force can't lost. Instead gets moved around transferred. That's underpinning principle this. whichever way break down, running high impact, high load activity. whether I'm running heel strike, whether I'm running forefoot strike, either way deal body weight coming top landing foot impact comes back that. question impact goes. I'm running heel strike, often also comes slight overstride, landing front myself, initial impact comes back body initial contact experienced. Ankle, knee, hip kinetic chain. initial impact, lot time, runners tend experience terms knee pain injury going start kick in. obviously, that's big generalization. lots different types injuries. terms sorts injuries overstriding, heel striking runners tend get it's. Things like telephone, real pain. runners knee it's. Things like tibial, stress fractures, even things like anterior compartment syndrome around front outside shin. classic kinds injuries heel striking runners pick they're tissues get overloaded type heel striking pattern. Now, move heel striking runner forefoot striking pattern, know that's going take little bit stress strain off, example, knee femoral joint. know going put ankle different position that's initial contact, means initial eccentric load muscles like asked anterior, going less we're less likely dealing things like anterior compartment syndrome, need appreciate force go somewhere. reducing stress knee, end putting demand around ankle. Achilles, calf complex end working lot harder dissipate initial load. know two different types running style. one stressful calf Achilles complex stressful around knee particular, start make sensible decisions based individual running injury histories, potentially start think maybe changing running style not, maybe leaving alone. Maybe nothing running style, injury history, errors made training. we're thinking running style, got someone knee pain they're overstriding, logic would dictate perhaps bringing mid foot forefoot strike would help reduce knee, stress strain around knee. Whereas I've got someone who's exactly much fact they're overstriding heel striking they're dealing Achilles problems, they're dealing pain Achilles tendon calf problems, probably want take throw onto balls feet. need appreciate way different types foot strike put different stress strain different areas body start think injuries occurred past appropriate perhaps make subtle change offload previously injured area, making change might put stress strain injured area. that's exactly making big changes running style never good idea. Making small changes far safest way go allows body within kind parameters used start work making small improvements time adapting go, rather suddenly taking stress strain one place moving another, perhaps body ready stress strain go. fact, want learn little bit improve running style comes foot strike, check video uploaded channel weeks ago, talks far detailed approaches action actually starting improve foot strike, make little bit efficient little bit better comes running light underfoot. go check out.
