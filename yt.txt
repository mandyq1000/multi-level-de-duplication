Andy. You came all the way from Utah? No. I was in town for a self help seminar. How to Be in the Right Place at the Right Time. Holy cow, it's working. Oh, gosh. I guess your name will still be my phone is my emergency contact. I use boyfriends to avoid lectures from my parents. I don't want to wake up in a teal in a prison and then be all, like, near grounded. I'm just glad I could be here. Andy, I have to tell you something. I'm really, really sorry, but I'm seeing someone. Really? Yeah. Yes. Thank goodness. Me too. I just don't know how to tell you. Especially if you're dying. She's a Laker Girl. Oh, wow. It's cheerleader. Nice. No. Josephine Scripts. Barnacles of Boats in the Great Salt Lake. We call them Laker Girls, but they are kind of sex symbols in Utah. So who is the lucky guy? Well, it's a bit of a mess right now, but he's he is a professor and an astrophysicist. He's a legit genius. Hailey, I came as soon as I heard. Actually, that's not true. I stopped for tacos. Not him.
